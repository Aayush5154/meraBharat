        Football was introduced to India by British soldiers in the mid-nineteenth century. It spread because of the efforts of Nagendra Prasad Sarbadhikari. In 1888 the Durand Cup was founded by then India's Foreign Secretary, Mortimer Durand at Shimla, India. The Durand Cup is the third oldest football competition behind the FA Cup and the Scottish Cup.[citation needed] It was initiated, as a recreation for British troops stationed in India. Royal Scots Fusiliers won the first edition of the cup by beating Highland Light Infantry 2-1 in the final. In 1893, the IFA Shield was founded as the fourth oldest trophy in the world.[citation needed] Calcutta, then capital of British India, soon became the hub of Indian football. Sarada FC was the oldest Indian football club.
