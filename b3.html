            <p>Kabaddi is an ancient Indian sport that dates back thousands of years. It is a team sport played between two teams, with each team taking turns to send a "raider" into the opponent's half to tag as many defenders as possible and return safely to their own half.</p>

            <h2>Rules and Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The game is played on a rectangular court, and the raider must tag as many opponents as possible while chanting "kabaddi, kabaddi." Defenders, on the other hand, try to stop the raider and prevent them from returning to their half. Kabaddi has various formats, including Standard style, Circle style, and Beach Kabaddi.</p>
